# LSTM-Quic-Website-Fingerprinting

## Dataset
The traces for our experiment are available [here](https://mega.nz/folder/pZdgCChS#E1JMxCFwzI5wtaDlw45QYA). They need to be cleaned for easy reading via libraries such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). To do so, run automate_clean_data with both tar files in the git root directory. This cleans, extracts the data. The data can be found in Data_Processing after the process is finished.

The Experiments folder contains code for the different evaluations done, as well as the models used and the auxillary functions such as read data.
